#Overal solver logic loop - WIP
# 1) Iterate through all cells. For each cell based on the information known about it and the surrounding cells:
#   a) if the cell is unknown, can we determine if it is empty or a ship?
#   b) if a known ship of unknown type, can we determine what type of ship it is?
#   c) if it is a ship, can we determine what that means for any adjacent cells
#   d) Once a cell and all of its adjacent cells are complete, mark as complete, and skip for future passes 
# 2) Iterate through all rows and columns. For each line:
#   a) Can we determine any cells must be empty? e.g. line already has max number of ships
#   b) Can we determine any cells which must be a boat? e.g. all remaining blank cells must be ships to satisfy line total
# 3) Implement more complex logic e.g. remaining possible locations for large ships.

#Intial board setup
#None = unknown cell
#0 = Empty - empty cell
#1 = Single = Round single cell ship
#2 = Up - End of a ship where the connecting side is facing up
#3 = Right - similar to above
#4 = Down - similar to above
#5 = Left - similar to above
#6 = Middle - middle section of a ship
#7 = Boat of unknown type - could be middle or end of a boat (or a single boat)
