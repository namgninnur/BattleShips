#Required functions

#Initial input
#####

#Overal solver logic loop
# Rule out cells in full rows
# Rule out cells touching a ship
# Include cells that are known extensions of a partial ship

#Intial board setup
#None = unknown cell
#0 = Empty - empty cell
#1 = Single = Round single cell ship
#2 = Up - End of a ship where the connecting side is facing up
#3 = Right - similar to above
#4 = Down - similar to above
#5 = Left - similar to above
#6 = Middle - middle section of a ship
#7 = Boat of unknown type - could be middle or end of a boat
